### The $ORIGIN Directive
```
Syntax: $ORIGIN domain-name [comment]
```

__$ORIGIN__ sets the domain name that is appended to any unqualified records (those without a terminating dot). If an __$ORIGIN__ directive is not defined - BIND synthesizes an __$ORIGIN__ from the zone name in the named.conf file as illustrated below:
```
//named.conf file fragment

zone "ponyworld.srv" in {
        type master;
        file "forward.ponyworld.srv";
};
```

In the above fragment __$ORIGIN__ example.com. is synthesized if none present in the zone file (forward.ponyworld.srv).

__$ORIGIN__ is used in two contexts during zone file processing:
1. The symbol @ forces substitution of the current (or synthesized) value of __$ORIGIN__.
2. The current value of __$ORIGIN__ is added to any 'unqualified' name (any name which does not end in a dot).

### The $TTL  Directive
__$TTL__ is defined in [RFC 2308](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2308.html)
Syntax
```
$TTL default-ttl [comment]
```

This sets the default Time-To-Live (__TTL__) for subsequent records with undefined __TTLs__. Valid TTLs are of the range 0-2147483647 seconds.

### The @ (at-sign)
When used in the label (or name) field, at-sign (@) symbol represents the current origin.

### The $INCLUDE Directive
Syntax:
```
$INCLUDE filename [origin] [comment]
```

This reads and processes the file __filename__ as if it were included in the file at this point. The __filename__ can be an absolute path, or a relative path.
