## DNS Reource Records (RRs)
`DNS resource records (RRs)` describe the characteristics of a zone (or domain) and have a `binary or wire-format`, which is used in queries and responses, and a text format used in [Zone Files](3.1-zone-file) which is described in this chapter.

### DNS Generic Record Format
Resource Records have two representations. A textual format described in this chapter and a __binary or wire-format__ describe in [Pro DNS and Bind, Chapter 15](https://www.zytrax.com/books/dns/ch15/)

The textual format has the following generic form:
```
owner-name [TTL] [class] [RR type] [RDATA]
or
owner-name [class] [TTL] [RR type] [RDATA]
```
where:

Column|Description
---|---
owner-name | The owner-name (or label) of the node in thhe zone file to which this record belongs. The owner-name field may also take one of the following values: `@ ; replace with the current value of $ORIGIN` or ` ; blank/space or tab in which case the last owner-name will be used`.
TTL | 32 bit value, a decimal integer, optional. __The Time to Live__ in seconds (range is 1 to 2137383647) and indicates how long the RR may be cached. The value zero indicates the data should not be cached.
class | A 16 bit value which defines the protocol family or an instance of the protocol, optional. The normal value is __IN__ = __Internet protocol__
__RR type__ | The resource record type which determines the value(s) of the ___type-specific-dta___ field. The complete list of RR types can be found [IANA
type-specific-data| Data content of each record is defined by the ___type___ and ___class___ values.

Omited ___class___ and ___ttl___ values are default to the last explicitly stated values.

### DNS Resource Record (RR) Types
This is an incomplete list, a more detailed list can be found in [Pro DNS and Bind, Chapter 8 DNS RR Types](https://www.zytrax.com/books/dns/ch8/#types). The full list of __DNS Resource Record (RR) types__ may be obtained from [IANA DNS Parameters](http://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-parameters).

RR | Value   | RFC                                                          | Description
-|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-
A | 1       | [RFC 1035](https://www.iana.org/go/rfc1035) | IPv4 Address record. An IPv6 address for a host
AAAA | 28 | [RFC 3596](https://www.iana.org/go/rfc3596) | IPv6 Adress record for a host
CNAME | 5 | [RFC 1035](https://www.iana.org/go/rfc1035) | Canonical Name. An alias name for a host. Causes redirection for a single RR at the owner-name.
DNAME | 39 | [RFC 6672](https://www.iana.org/go/rfc6672) | Redirection in DNS. Like CNAME but provides redirection for a subtree of the domain name tree in the DNS. That is, all names that end with a particular suffix are redirected to another parf of the DNS. <br>`frobozz.example.net.  DNAME    frobozz-division.acme.example.com.`
NS | 2 | [RFC 1035](https://www.iana.org/go/rfc1035)| Name Server. Defines the authoritative names server(s) for the domain (defined by the SOA record) or the subdomain.
PTR| 12| [RFC 1035](https://www.iana.org/go/rfc1035)| IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) to host. Used in reverse maps.
SOA|6|[RFC 1035](https://www.iana.org/go/rfc1035)| Start of Authority. Defines the zone name, an e-mail contact and various time and refresh values applicable to the zone.


The generic binary or wire-format is:
```
name ttl class type rdlen rdata
```
The binary format is describe in [Pro DNS and Bind, chapter 15 RR format](https://www.zytrax.com/books/dns/ch15/#answer)

### Class Of Resource Records
Class|Description
---|---
__IN__| The Internet. The only widely class uned today
__CH__|Chaosnet, a LAN protocol created at MIT in the mid-1970s. It was rarely used, but was reused for BIND's built-in server information zones, e.g., __version.bind__
__HS__|Hesiod, an information service developed by MIT, used to share information about various systems databases.

### Discussion Of MX Records
MX records are used to control delivery of email. The data specified in the record is a priority and a domain name. The priority controls the order in which email delivery is attempted, with the lowest number first. The domain name given is the machine to which the mail is delivered. It must have an associated address record (A or AAAA); CNAME is not sufficient.

Domain name|Class| RR Type | Priority |Mail Server
---|---|---|----------|---|
example.com|__IN__| __MX__| 10       |mail.example.com.
  --|__IN__| __MX__ | 10       |mail2.example.com
  --|__IN__| __MX__ | 10       |mail.backup.org
mail.example.com.|__IN__| __A__ | 10.0.0.1 |
mail2.example.com.|__IN__| __A__ | 10.0.0.2 |
