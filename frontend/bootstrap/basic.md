### Bootstrap 5
- requires the HTML5 doctype
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Bootstrap 5 Example</title>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
  </head>
</html>
```

- is mobile-first and designed to be responsive to mobile devices.
```
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```
- `width=device-width` sets the width of page to follow the screen-width of the device
- ``initial-scale=1`` sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser
- requires a containing element to wrap site contents
