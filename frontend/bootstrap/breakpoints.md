#### Core concepts
- Breakpoints are the building blocks of responsive design. Use them to control when your layout can be adapted at a particular viewport or device size.
- Use media queries to architect your CSS by breakpoint. Media queries are a feature of CSS that allow you to conditionally apply styles based on a set of browser and operating system parameters. Bootstrap most commonly use min-width in media queries.
- Mobile first, responseive design is the goal.

#### Available breakpoints
Boolstrap includes six default breakpoints, sometimes referred to as ``grid tiers``, for building responsively.
